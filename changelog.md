# Weavy 13.0.0 (2022-09-07)

The authentication mechanism has changed in Weavy v13. 
In previous versions, authentication was handled using identity providers and self signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 
This has been replaced by server generated access tokens. 

We also present a fully featured file preview in uikit-react. 
You are now able to preview images, videos, pdf, office, google drive, markdown, code and more.

## Breaking changes

All authentication implementations made for earlier versions needs to be updated in order to incorporate the new authentication mechanisms. 

Refer to these articles for more information: 

* [Drop-in UI authentication](https://weavy.com/docs/frontend/drop-in/authentication)
* [React UI kit authentication](https://weavy.com/docs/frontend/uikit-react/authentication)
* [Web API authentication](https://www.weavy.com/docs/backend/api/authentication)

## Changelog

* New authentication mechanism using server generated access tokens instead of self signed JWTs.
* Added complete file preview in uikit-react.
* Improved file preview with syntax highlighting for supported file types.
* Improved file preview with Markdown rendering for .md files.
* Changed property app.id to app.uid in dropin-js.
* Removed quick app select syntax in dropin-js. Apps can now only be selected using options instead of passing a string.

## Upgrade instructions

* Delete the /index folder containing the fulltext index (it will be re-created on startup).
* Backup and update your database schema by following the instructions when Weavy starts up.

> When upgrading to v13 the `iss` and `sub` claims on your existing users will be concatenated and used as `uid`. 
> For example, a user with `iss=myissuer` and `sub=6783` will get `uid=myissuer|6783` after the upgrade.
